The development of technology is getting faster and faster. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the fields of science that plays a major role in it. Unconsciously, almost everyone uses products that are produced by the application of machine learning.
Machine Learning is an analytical method that helps deal with big data by developing computer algorithms.  Machine Learning (ML) is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine learning is an artificial intelligence application that provides an automatic performance system and learns to improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
One example of the application and development of machine learning is automatic control on a Tesla car. The application of machine learning in automatic control cars is very complex because there are a lot things to learned by Machine Learning. Machine learning in the automatic control system works to learn traffic signs, direction and destination, road conditions, traffic light, surrounding human conditions, and other integrated sensors.
There are still a bunch things that machine learning can do for human needs. I also think the corona virus vaccine can be found with machine learning technology.
